Altercations to code

-Brennan List of slightly altered code for my purposes

Whenever I work not all code is imeediately loaded into unity
I have to alter the code slightly to work in the form of an extra space or comment

loaded all, lead to missing assets that I could not fix

had to undo one of the fixing to get the asset problem
CountdownTimer not present

caused another problem
commented out line 30 in EnemyMovement in Maze folder of scripts

uncomment out to have enerything work as intended
