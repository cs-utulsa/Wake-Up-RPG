# About 

This is the major project for the year long senior software class. The focus on this repository is to create a phone game that will inspire users to get a start on their day.
The minimal viable product for this game consists of a week of game play including introductory materieal and a unique setting with mini games and narration. 

Sprint specific documents and methodology can be found in the wiki.
